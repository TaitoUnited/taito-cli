## 2. Installation and upgrade

### Prerequisites

The following software needs to be installed on your computer before you can install Taito CLI.

- [Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) (already included on Linux and macOS)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

#### Additional details

**Linux:** See [Docker Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

**Windows:** It is recommended to use [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/). Make sure you follow the best practices mentioned in the docker installation instructions. That is, source code should be located on Linux disk. You can use [Visual Studio Code Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) to modify the source code remotely from Windows. If you are using some other editor than VS Code, you can use some other sync mechanism to copy changed files from Windows to Linux (e.g. [atom-sync-cygwin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-sync-cygwin), [Cygwin rsync](https://cygwin.com/packages/summary/rsync.html), [cwRsync](https://www.itefix.net/cwrsync))

> If you cannot use [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) on Windows, you can try some bash emulation instead (e.g. [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)). However, [docker-for-win#1588](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1588) may cause you some trouble. You can also try to run Docker inside a Linux virtual machine.

### Automatic installation

1. Install Taito CLI by running the following commands on your unix-like shell (e.g. bash):

   ```shell
   export TAITO_INSTALL_DIR=~/.taito-cli
   export TAITO_GIT_CLONE_METHOD=ssh  # https or ssh
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/master/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Finalize the installation by running commands the aforementioned install.sh script displayed at the end:

   ```
   [8. Almost finished]

   Finalize the installation with the following steps:

     1. Execute final installation steps by running 'taito upgrade'
     2. Check the installation by running 'taito check'
     3. Show taito commands with 'taito -h'

   If you have problems, run 'taito trouble' to display troubleshooting.
   You can read troubleshooting also at GitHub:
   https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/master/trouble.txt
   ```

3. Optional: Install Taito CLI plugin for your [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/vscode-taito-cli) or [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/atom-taito-cli) editor.

### Manual installation

1. See the [install.sh](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/master/install.sh) script and execute the steps manually in any way you like.

2. Optional: Install Taito CLI plugin for your [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/vscode-taito-cli) or [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/atom-taito-cli) editor.

### Upgrade

You can upgrade Taito CLI and its extensions anytime by running `taito upgrade`.
