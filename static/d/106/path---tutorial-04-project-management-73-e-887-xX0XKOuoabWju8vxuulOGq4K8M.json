Project management</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TODO: These commands have not yet been implemented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>TODO scrum + kanban + safe references.</p>\n<h3>4.1. Issues</h3>\n<p>Whether you are working alone or as a team, it's best to document, coordinate and prioritize the work somehow. Taito CLI provides you commands that you can use to quickly manage issues directly from command line.</p>\n<p>Try the following commands. Note that the given issue title don't have to be an exact match. If no exact match is found, command finds the closest matching issue title and confirms that it is the correct issue.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Open project management on browser</span>\ntaito <span class=\"token function\">open</span> project\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Authenticate to the issue management system</span>\ntaito issue auth\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Add a new issue with labels 'feature' and 'posts'.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># You'll be asked to enter issue description once you run the command.</span>\ntaito issue add: delete post - feature posts\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># List all issues on todo lane</span>\ntaito issue list: todo\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Change issue status to: in progress, assigned to me.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># You'll be asked for a comment, but you can leave it empty.</span>\ntaito issue status: delete post - <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> progress - me\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Add comment on issue.</span>\ntaito issue comment: delete post\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Change issue status to: testing, assigned to John Doe</span>\ntaito issue status: delete post - testing - john doe\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Open issue on browser</span>\ntaito issue open: delete post</code></pre></div>\n<p>TODO autocomplete at least for status, labels and personnel?</p>\n<h3>4.2. Hour reporting</h3>\n<p>You can also do work hour reporting with Taito CLI directly from command line. This is especially handy if you need to enter the same hour entries to multiple hour reporting systems. With Taito CLI you can input your work hours to multiple systems at once with a single command. You just need to enable multiple Taito CLI hour reporting plugins in your project <code class=\"language-text\">taito-config.sh</code>.</p>\n<p>Try the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">taito hours auth                         <span class=\"token comment\"># Authenticate</span>\ntaito hours start                        <span class=\"token comment\"># Start/continue the timer</span>\ntaito hours pause                        <span class=\"token comment\"># Pause the timer</span>\ntaito hours stop                         <span class=\"token comment\"># Stop the timer and create an hour entry</span>\ntaito hours add: 6.5                     <span class=\"token comment\"># Add an hour entry for today</span>\ntaito hours add: 6.5 yesterday           <span class=\"token comment\"># Add an hour entry for yesterday</span>\ntaito hours add: 6.5 tue Did some work   <span class=\"token comment\"># Add an hour entry for last tuesday</span>\ntaito hours list                         <span class=\"token comment\"># Hour entries of this month</span>\ntaito hours list: all                    <span class=\"token comment\"># Hour entries of this month for all projects</span>\ntaito hours summary                      <span class=\"token comment\"># Hour summary for this month</span>\ntaito hours summary: this-week           <span class=\"token comment\"># Hour summary for this week</span>\ntaito <span class=\"token function\">open</span> hours                         <span class=\"token comment\"># Open hour reporting on browser</span>\n\nTODO bulk adds <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>e.g. three weeks on vacation<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong> <a href=\"/tutorial/05-remote-environments\">PART II: Environments</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"5f7bbe2a-ebbb-59db-a6ea-3f2759290067"}}
