## 2. Installation and upgrade

### Prerequisites

The following software needs to be installed on your computer before you can install Taito CLI.

- [Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) (or bash-like shell)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Note for Linux:**

See [Docker Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

**Note for Windows:**

Taito CLI has not been tested on Windows. It won't probably work yet.

### Installation

1. Clone taito-cli git repository and checkout the master branch:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:TaitoUnited/taito-cli.git
   # Or with HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli.git

   cd taito-cli
   git checkout master
   ```

2. Symlink the file named **taito** to your PATH. It's a bash script that runs Taito CLI as a Docker container. For example:

   ```shell
   sudo ln -s /home/myname/projects/taito-cli/taito /usr/local/bin/taito
   ```

3. Configure your personal settings in `~/.taito/taito-config.sh` (see the example below). If you work for an organization that uses Taito CLI, they will provide you the correct settings. See [Advanced Usage](/docs/03-usage#advanced-usage) if you need to configure settings for multiple organizations.

   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   # shellcheck disable=SC2034

   # Taito CLI
   taito_global_plugins="git-global docker-global google-global gcloud-global
     links-global template-global"

   # Docker
   # NOTE: set to true if you get networking errors when running 'taito db' commands
   docker_legacy_networking=false

   # Links
   link_global_urls="
     * home=https://www.myorganization.com
     * intra=https://intra.myorganization.com Intranet
     * conventions=https://intra.myorganization.com/conventions Software development conventions
     * hours=https://hours.myorganization.com Hour reporting
     * playgrounds=https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ataito-playground+org%3AMyOrganization&type=Repositories Playground projects
   "

   # --- infrastructure template settings ---
   template_default_zone_source_git=git@github.com:TaitoUnited/taito-infrastructure//templates

   # --- Project template settings ---
   # Define default settings for newly created projects here
   ```

4. Optional steps:

   - Install autocompletion for your shell: [support/README.md](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/tree/master/support#shell-support).
   - Install Taito CLI plugin for your editor (TODO: not implemented yet): [Atom](https://github.com/keskiju/atom-taito-cli), [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/keskiju/vscode-taito-cli)

5. Try it:

   - Run `taito -h` to show taito help.
