## 5. Configuration

By default only the _basic_ plugin is enabled. You can configure your personal settings in `~/.taito/taito-config.sh` file and organization specific overrides in `~/.taito/taito-config-ORGANIZATION.sh` file. See the [installation and upgrade](02-installation) chapter for an example of a personal configuration file.

Project specific settings are defined in `taito-config.sh` file placed at your project root folder. See [taito-config.sh](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/server-template/blob/master/taito-config.sh) of full-stack-template as an example. In addition, user specific overrides may be defined in `taito-user-config.sh` file located at project root folder. The user specific file should not be committed to version control.

Settings are defined as environment variables. If an environment variable contains multiple values, just write them using whitespace as delimiter, for example:

```shell
taito_environments="dev test canary prod"
```

TIP: You can easily use `taito-config.sh` settings in your own custom scripts. For example [post-build.sh](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/react-native-template/blob/dev/scripts/appcenter/post-build.sh#L9) script of react-native-template uses taito-config.sh settings to send Slack notification after App Center build has ended:

```shell
# Read settings from taito-config.sh
set -a
taito_target_env=${APPCENTER_BRANCH/master/prod}
. taito-config.sh
set +a
```

### Common settings in personal or organizational configuration file

The following settings are shared among plugins. All of them are optional.

- **taito_image:** Taito CLI Docker image that is used for running the taito commands. The default value is `taitounited/taito-cli:latest`.
- **taito_zone:** The default taito zone. You can usually leave this empty.
- **taito_global_extensions:** Globally enabled Taito CLI extensions. You can reference an extension by using a local file path, git repository path or an url to a **tar.gz** archive. TODO example values.
- **taito_global_plugins:** Globally enabled Taito CLI plugins.

[Plugins](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/dev/docs/plugins) named with a `-global` suffix are designed to be used globally. That is, you configure them in your personal or organizational configuration file.

### Template settings in personal or organizational configuration file

### Plugin specific settings

Plugin specific settings are prefixed with the plugin name and documented in README.md file of [each plugin](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/dev/docs/plugins).

_TODO: Write README.md for each plugin._

### Environment specific project settings

You can use bash script constructs to define different values for different environments, for example:

```shell
# Overrides for different environments
case $taito_env in
  prod)
    # settings for production
    ;;
  stag)
    # settings for staging
    ;;
  test)
    # settings for testing
    ;;
  dev)
    # settings for development
    ;;
  local)
    # settings for local
    ;;
esac
```

### Feature environments

> TODO: feature environment support is still work-in-progress

You can also create an environment for your your feature branch. See the example below for `feature/orders`.

1. Configure `f-orders` environment in `taito-config.sh`:

   ```shell
   # Environments
   taito_environments="f-orders dev test prod"
   ```

   ```shell
   # Overrides for different environments
   case $taito_env in
     ...
     ...
     dev|f-orders)
       # settings for dev and feature/orders
       ;;
     ...
     ...
   esac
   ```

2. Create the environment by running `taito env apply:f-orders`.

3. Push some changes to `feature/orders` branch and your application should be deployed automatically.

### Canary environment

You can create a **canary environment** by renaming `canary` environment to `prod` at the beginning of the project specific configuration file (see the example below). This means that the canary release is deployed to the same cluster and namespace as production, and it also uses all the same resources as production (database, storage, 3rd party services).

```shell
# Environments
taito_env=${taito_env/canary/prod} # canary -> prod
```

```shell
# Overrides for different environments
case $taito_env in
  prod)
    # settings for production

    if [[ $taito_target_env == "canary" ]]; then
      # settings for canary
    fi
    ;;
  stag)
    ...
    ...
esac
```

### Alternative environments

You can make an alternative environment for A/B testing the same way that you do with canary. In the following example the `feature/orders-b` uses resources of production environment. Thus, you can do A/B testing in production by routing some of the users to the `feature/orders-b` release that is running side-by-side with the production version.

```shell
# Environments
taito_env=${taito_env/f-orders-b/prod} # f-orders-b -> prod
```

```shell
# Overrides for different environments
case $taito_env in
  prod)
    # settings for production

    if [[ $taito_target_env == "f-orders-b" ]]; then
      # settings for feature/orders-b
    fi
    ;;
  stag)
    ...
    ...
esac
```

### Test suite parameters

You can define parameters for your e2e and integration test suites by using `test_TARGET_` as prefix. See the end of [taito-config.sh](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/server-template/blob/master/taito-config.sh) file of full-stack-template as an example.

### Secret management

Plugins require secrets to perform some of the operations. Secrets are configured in `taito-config.sh` using the `taito_secrets` variable and secret values can be managed with the `taito env apply:ENV` and `taito env rotate:ENV` commands. See [taito-config.sh](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/server-template/blob/master/taito-config.sh) of full-stack-template for examples.

Secret naming convention is **name.property[/namespace]:method**. For example:

* *silicon-valley-prod-basic-auth.auth:htpasswd*: User credentials for basic authentication. Use `htpasswd-plain` instead of `htpasswd` if you want to store the passwords in plain text (e.g. for development purposes).
* *silicon-valley-prod-twilio.apikey:manual*: API key for external Twilio service for sending sms messages. The token is asked from user during the environment creation and secret rotation process.
* *silicon_valley_prod-db-app.password:random*: A randomly generated database password for silicon valley production database (named silicon_valley_prod) to be used by application.
* *silicon_valley_prod-db-mgr.password/devops:random*: A randomly generated database password for silicon valley production database (named silicon_valley_prod) to be in managing the database (for CI/CD, etc). It is saved to devops namespace as it is not required by the application.
* *cloudsql-gserviceaccount.key:copy/devops*: A token for external google-cloudsql service that acts as a database proxy. Token is copied from devops namespace to this one.
* *github-buildbot.token:read/devops*: A token to access GitHub when making a release. Token is read from devops namespace, but need not be saved as it is only needed by CI/CD during build.

See the [secret management](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/blob/dev/docs/plugins.md#secret-management) section of the plugins page for more information.
