# Templates

## Infrastructure templates

Taito CLI comes with some simple [infrastucture templates](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-cli/tree/master/examples/zones/README) that you can use as an example to set up your infrastructure. You may also find more infrastructure templates on [GitHub](TODO).
